    <p>These AI-generated images were created using Leonardo.ai to visually represent key programming concepts and computing history. The gallery features an image of an old computer to evoke the early days of computing, alongside visual metaphors for loops and conditional statements in C programming, aiding in conceptual understanding through visual storytelling.</p>

  <h2>📚 Literature Mapping Summary</h2>
  <p>Literature Mapping via ResearchRabbit:</p>
  <p>
I have used ResearchRabbit,a and I worked on the subject of “AI- and ML-based Smart Waste Management” by producing two visual literature graphs(Shown in this file). Starting from Gupta (2019) as my starting paper, where AI-based waste solutions for cities are discussed, I was taken on a research path by ResearchRabbit revealing to me an elaborate network of co-referred works that constitute highly relevant articles such as Vicentini (2009) and Arebey (2011), wherein optimization and sensor technologies in managing waste are deliberated upon. The tool enabled me to easily find papers that extended or were based on my seed paper, and the process of discovery was intuitive and fun.</p>

  <h2>✍️ Reflective Note</h2>
  <p><i>“AI has transformed my way of teaching by making everything easier and more creative. I can now create lessons, quizzes, and images much faster than before. Tools like ChatGPT help me prepare questions and summaries in minutes. AI also makes learning more fun for students with interactive flashcards, visuals, and even podcasts. It saves me time and gives me new ideas to teach in a better way. I feel more confident and excited to try new things in class. AI has truly changed the way I teach and connect with my students. It made my content creation faster, my quizzes more interactive, and helped me explore new forms of student engagement.”</i></p>
